    1) 
        a) paranthesis are used to define a tuple, but theyre represented just with
           stars
        b) isABC has a different type because it is taking in 1 argument, a tuple
           with 3 elements. isDEF takes 3 individual arguments, hence the 3 arrows
        c) every arrow represents a currying. every argument is curried to the next
