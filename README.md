# CS105 - Programming Languages
This repository contains all of my projects for CS105. This class taught the formal mathematical foundations of languages, such as abstract syntax, semantics, and type systems.
## Projects
- ```impcore``` - Gaining familiarity writing functions from algebraic laws
- ```Opsem```  - Introducing the basics of operational semantics, inference rules, and syntactic proof techniques, providing foundational skills for understanding and analyzing new programming languages
- ```Scheme``` - Focused on functional programming with lists, emphasizing immutability and composability while reinforcing programming-language theory, operational semantics, and calculational proofs
- ```HOFs``` - Designing and using first-order and higher-order functions
- ```Continuations``` - Using continuation passing style to implement a SAT solver
- ```ML``` - Using pattern matching and user-defined datatypes
- ```Type Systems``` - Implementing a type checker from scratch, introducing polymorphism
- ```Inference``` - Implementing the Hindley Milner type system that allows type inference
